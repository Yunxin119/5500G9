**Hiring Team at Ivo**  
San Francisco Bay Area  

**Dear Hiring Team,**  

I’m excited to apply for the Software Engineer position at Ivo. With a strong background in full-stack development, applied AI integrations, and a passion for building impactful products, I’m eager to contribute to your mission of revolutionizing contract negotiation through cutting-edge technology. As an early engineering hire, I’d thrive in the dynamic, fast-paced environment you’ve described, combining technical rigor with pragmatic problem-solving to drive user-centric solutions.  

At VOC.AI, I built a distributed Amazon review analysis system using **Spring Boot, Kafka, and GPT** for sentiment analysis, processing 39.5K comments within two weeks. This experience aligns with your work leveraging LLMs to solve complex problems at scale. Additionally, I designed performance dashboards with dynamic **SQL queries** and optimized systems for corporate clients—skills transferable to enhancing your product’s data-driven insights.  

My frontend expertise includes developing platforms with **React, Vue, and Node.js** (key parts of your stack). At MOGU Inc., I boosted reconciliation efficiency by 60% through API optimizations and reduced codebase complexity by 40% via refactoring. I also built a Chrome extension for speech-to-text conversion (optimized for ChatGPT), demonstrating my ability to innovate around user workflows—a perfect fit for Ivo’s focus on pragmatic, high-impact solutions.  

What excites me most about Ivo is the opportunity to work closely with founders to shape a product already trusted by industry leaders. My startup-like agility (evidenced by rapid iterations at NetEase and automating workflows saving 70 minutes daily) and passion for applied AI would let me hit the ground running. I’d love to discuss how my skills in **React, Node.js, and Firebase** (from personal projects) could accelerate your roadmap.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. I’d welcome the chance to discuss how my background aligns with your needs. I’m available at your earliest convenience and can relocate to San Francisco promptly. Looking forward to your reply.  

**Best regards,**  
Shikai Jin
